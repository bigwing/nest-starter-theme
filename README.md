<h1>Opubco-Starter-Theme</h1>
====================

WordPress theme framework for Opubco

This theme includes various features to extend the ease of use as well as offer some basic funcionality for SEO.

<h3>Included Features</h3>

<b>Custom Meta Box class for creating custom fields.<b>

There are some great plugins out there that allows you to add all kinds of custom fields.
But for most clients putting that control in there hands can sometimes cause problems
so I included this so that we can code into the site instead. This way we can create the 
functionality and the client can't break it. 

<b>Included Theme Options</b>

Theme options framework is included. This way we can quickly add needed options for each 
theme as well as include our basic options with each theme. 

<b>Schema.org Markup</b>

Basic Schema.org markup included into contact info and navigation items. We will add more
options in the future for posts and pages.

<b>Featured Posts Checkbox</b>

Instead of using sticky posts or making a featured category we made it easy to select 
featured posts that can be displayed anywhere on the site with a convientent shortcode.

<b>Testimonials</b>

Most businesses have testimonials. This section has been built directly into the admin. 
There is also a shortcode with a slider so that shortcodes can fade in and out anywhere 
on your site.

<b>Built in Slider</b>

There is a built in optional slider. The features for this slider are basic but I plan to 
extend these features in the future.
